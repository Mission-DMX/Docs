# List Command

The list command is used to print the content of the specified container.
Use `help list` to get a list of current available containers.

In order to list a specific category of assets, append the category to `-asset`.
For example, if you'd like to list all images, type `list image-assets`.
If you'd like to see all assets, type `list all-assets`.
