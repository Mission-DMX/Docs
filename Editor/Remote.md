# Remote Control

A show file can be remotely controlled using two primary methods: remote desktop connections or using the remote CLI port.
Using a tablet PC to remotely operate a show is best done using a VNC connection to access the show UI pages.

Besides this, it is possible to use telnet port `2929` to access the command line interface of the editor (if enabled).
This can be used to integrate third party scripting sources (like a Stream Deck) into show file control.
