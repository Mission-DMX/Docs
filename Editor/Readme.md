# Mission DMX user guide

This document describes how to use the Mission DMX lighting control desk.

Basically, there are two ways to use the control desk. The first option is to quickly [patch some fixtures](Patching.md) and then control their DMX values directly using the [quick console view](Console.md). While this method is great for testing small things or even some small and static setups, it does not scale. The second option is to first [build a show file](ShowfileWorkflow.md) and then operate it using the [Show Control](ShowGUI.md).

TODO introduce advanced views such as debug view and settings

TODO write a table of contents for each manual entry

TODO write manual about CLI (socket and in-editor terminal)
