# filter types
The following file specifies the type identifiers as well as the channel names of the filters.

## Constants
These filters provide constant inputs and their values can be updated from the GUI.
### 8 bit constant
- Type name: `constants:8bit`
- Type id: `0`
- Input channels: None
- Output channels:
  * `value`: the stored 8 bit value
- Configuration parameters: None
- initial parameters:
  * `value`: the content of the storage to be set (needs to be parsable as an int)
- GUI update keys:
  * `value`: the content of the storage to be set (needs to be parsable as an int)

### 16 bit constant
- Type name: `constants:16bit`
- Type id: `1`
- Input channels: None
- Output channels:
  * `value`: the stored 16 bit value
- Configuration parameters: None
- initial parameters:
  * `value`: the content of the storage to be set (needs to be parsable as an int)
- GUI update keys:
  * `value`: the content of the storage to be set (needs to be parsable as an int)

### float constant
- Type name: `constants:float`
- Type id: `2`
- Input channels: None
- Output channels:
  * `value`: the stored double value
- Configuration parameters: None
- initial parameters:
  * `value`: the content of the storage to be set (needs to be parsable as a double)
- GUI update keys:
  * `value`: the content of the storage to be set (needs to be parsable as a double)

### color constant
- Type name: `constants:pixel`
- Type id: `3`
- Input channels: None
- Output channels:
  * `value`: the stored color value
- Configuration parameters: None
- initial parameters:
  * `value`: the content of the storage to be set (needs to be in the color format specified below)
- GUI update keys:
  * `value`: the content of the storage to be set (needs to be in the color format specified below)
#### color format
The following format can be parsed: `<hue as a double>,<saturation as a double>,<value as a double>`.
For example: `180.0,1.0,1.0` is a cyan like color.
