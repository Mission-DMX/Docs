# BMX Breakout adapter

![PCB layout of DMX breakout adapter](blog_images/dmx_breakout_adapter.png)

During development of a control bord for the lighting desk, we're tasked with measuing DMX signals many times.
While cutting up an DMX cable in order to attach an oscilloscope would be an option, this isn't a particualry nice approach as it would ruin the shielding.
As a consequence I've developed a breakout board with SMA connectors. Feel free to reach out to us if you'd like to have the schematics or one for yourself.
